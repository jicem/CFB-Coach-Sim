text = "In Armchair Coach: College Football, you can simulate being the head coach at one of 80 college football programs. You'll be more of a CEO than an X's and O's coach, so your focus will be on hiring the right coordinators to maximize your talent on the field and helping to develop that talent between games.

To start, look through the schools on the school selection screen to see which one you might be interested in coaching for. Once you've made a choice, enter the number in its ID column in the text box at the bottom of the screen. Alternately, you can select the school's row in the table, and the number will be added to the text box automatically. After that, simply click \"Submit\", and you'll be able to view that school's roster. If you're happy with the roster, you'll be able to customize your coach from there.

You can choose your coach's name, choose his or her offensive style and defensive style, and customize your coach's appearance from several different options on the next screen. After you do that, you can hire offensive and defensive coordinators for your new team. "
