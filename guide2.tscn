text = "When signing your offensive and defensive coordinators, the first thing you'll see is your school's budget. You'll want to maximize your budget to sign the best coordinators you can, as they'll contribute to how your team performs on-field. You also want to keep the offensive and defensive styles of the coordinators in mind, as if their coaching styles are compatible with yours, your team will play slightly better during the season. Each coordinator will have a unique ID, similar to the schools, and to sign a coordinator, you simply need to put their ID in the text box or select their row in the table to autofill the text box with their ID. If you run out of money or just don't want to sign a coordinator for some reason, you can skip one or both phases of coordinator signing, though it isn't recommended.

After signing your coordinators, you'll be able to view your roster again and then start the season. To progress through the season, you simply need to click the button at the bottom of the page that says \"Sim to Week 1\", \"Sim to Week 2\", etc. You'll also be able to run practices and, starting in the fifth week, view the rankings for the College Football Invitational. The CFI rankings after the conference championships will determine who plays for the national championship or in one of 16 bowl games."
