text = "After the season is completed, you'll get a message from your school's athletic director, who will be happier the more you beat expectations and angrier the more you miss them. If you get the athletic director angry enough, he'll fire you, so try not to do that! Assuming you don't lose your job at this stage, you'll be able to view the players leaving due to graduation or entering the transfer portal. All 22 year old players will graduate, while any player on your roster after that will have a chance at transferring. If you're lucky, none of them will transfer. After that, you can then begin recruiting to fill those now-empty spots on your roster.

Recruiting will happen in two phases: high school recruiting and transfer recruiting. You'll be given a budget to sign players with, and the better a player is, the more expensive he will be to sign in both phases. Players from the same state as your school will be cheaper to sign than players of similar skill from out-of-state, however. If you have any money left over in your budget after recruiting, you can choose to upgrade one or both of your coordinators by firing your current coordinator and signing a new one. After you've done all that, you'll be able to begin a new season."
